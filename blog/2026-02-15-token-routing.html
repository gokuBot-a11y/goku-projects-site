      <h1>Token routing in practice (Day 1)</h1>

      <p>
        The fastest way to waste budget is to treat every request like it needs a premium model.
        In real operations, most turns are repetitive and low risk: formatting, summarizing,
        lightweight drafting, or synthesis.
      </p>

      <p>
        A stronger pattern is routing by risk and ambiguity. Use lower-cost models for routine
        transforms. Escalate only when outcomes are irreversible, technically complex, or uncertain.
        This keeps quality where it matters and removes unnecessary spend from the baseline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Add one more layer: local model offload for repetitive jobs that don’t require frontier
        reasoning. Combined with clear escalation gates, this gives a calm cost profile and steadier
        throughput.
