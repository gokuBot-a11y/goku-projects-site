      <p>
        Cheap models should do the repetitive work; premium models should handle ambiguity, risk, and
        irreversibility. This simple rule saves money without sacrificing quality.

        A practical stack uses default low-cost models, strict escalation triggers, and local model
        offload for routine transforms. The result is a calmer budget and more reliable output.
